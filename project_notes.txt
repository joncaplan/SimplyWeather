Project motivation: Can't easily get reasonable weather forecast on phone.
Best forecast seems to come from noaa.gov and is available in text format.
Getting this requires several steps on Android phone.

Project vision: Small app which displays forecast from NOAA for current location as text.

User interface:
	- text entry box for city, state or ZIP code
	- a refresh button
	- a text box for results

Back end:
	- Accept user input and request submit to NOAA.gov site.
	- Receive and parse response.
		- check for error message 
		- display forecast or error message

	
Future versions: 
	1.01 Retains last location (http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html)
	1.1  Adds option to get location from GPS/WiFi.
	2.0  Adds worldwide forecasts.


---------------------------------------------------
Implementation notes
	NOAA site is: http://forecast.weather.gov/zipcity.php
	Form is submitted by:
		<form method="POST" action="http://forecast.weather.gov/zipcity.php">
		<INPUT TYPE="submit" NAME="Go2" VALUE="Go">
		</form>
		
	Parsing HTML results page
	results start after:
		<img alt="Detailed text forecast" src="/images/wtf/fcst.jpg">
	results end just before next: 
		</td>	
	I should be able to do some simple string searching to cut down the input to the this section.
	I should check if I can do HTML display in a text element. That would nicely preserve the spacing and emphasis and save editing out tags.

	    	BUGS
	    		29. Sometimes forecasts don't auto-update when over 30 minutes old. CLOSED, NOT REPRODUCIBLE (See bug 32)
	    				Log says "Getting new forecast for Augusta ME" and "Default buffer size used in BufferedReder constructor. It would be better to be explicit if an 8k-char buffer is required." and then nothing but GC messages from dalvik.
	    				Note: This appears to be the result of having two copies of the same location. Re-test when bug 32 is fixed.
	    		30. Using ViewFlipper to switch forecasts triggers two "Getting new forecast for ..." log messages when forecast is over 30 minutes old. FIXED (onItemListener called when flipping views, which also check for refresh.)
	    				Note: No user impact other than data usage.
	    				Note: Does not occur with refresh button or from selecting location with drop-down menu (spinner).
	    		31. Yigo, Guam forecast returns error. This error is similar to what happens when NOAA server is down, so is worth handling. See bug 18. DEFERRED.
	    		32. User able to create more than one copy of location. CLOSED, NOT REPRODUCIBLE
	    				Solution: Compare request to location strings in database and on match simply switch to that location. Could even strip out comma before comparing.
	    				Note: Strings already compared. Not sure how I got duplicate location. Closing until I can reproduce. 
				33. Forecast not loading on 4.0.3 emulator. FIXED!! (Disabled automatic HTTP redirect.)
						Note: Internet access is broken on this emulator, but not on the Motorola 2.3.3 Bionic emulator. See if I can find a working 4.x emulator. 
							Also occurs on 3.x emulator with internet access working (tested with browser).
							Maybe this is depending on how the program id's itself for the HTTP request. Perhaps user agent is different. Nope. Faking user agent string changes nothing.
							Wireshark captures reveal that "&FcastType=dwml" is not getting appended to the request in the failed cases.
			    34. Multiple requests for forecast update. Occurs on app startup. May be associated with app crashing. - DEFERRED
				35. Crash at startup during background update: java.lang.RuntimeException: Can't create handler inside thread that has not called Looper.prepare() - BANDAGED and DEFERRED real fix. (Commented out offending code.) May be caused by bug 34.
								net.joncaplan.SimplyWeather.showToastMessage(SimplyWeather.java:999)
								net.joncaplan.SimplyWeather.getForecast(SimplyWeather.java:353)
								net.joncaplan.SimplyWeather$4.doInBackground(SimplyWeather.java:751)
								net.joncaplan.SimplyWeather$4.doInBackground(SimplyWeather.java:1)
								android.os.AsyncTask$2.call(AsyncTask.java:185)
				36. Alaska forecasts don't work on 4.0. (They do work on 2.1.) FIXED. (Same redirect problem as before, along with different header numbering.)
					
		Version 1.3.1
			Fix bug for San Francisco area forecasts. DONE 
				
			Bugs
				37. Error when getting forecast for some SF Bay area locations. Forecast pane displays: "Error is: Cause is: null Stack trace" FIXED.
					NOAA was giving bad values when it had no data. Also put try/catch blocks around most XML processing code.
					Skip printing local conditions on XML parse failure.
				38. Multiple copies of some locations appear. Cause unknown. Must investigate. DEFERRED. Note: Could be due to multiple updates happening at once. Observer to see if this still occurs.
				
		Version 1.3.5
				Add temperature and wind speed table - DONE
					Retrieve data from NOAA - DONE
					Display the data        - DONE
				Add Hazard Data
					Load and parse hazard data - DONE
					Display hazard data - IN PROGRESS
					
			Bugs
				39. Temperature table sometimes doesn't update. Should be FIXED. Test.
				40. Temperature table sometimes displays wrong location. Switching to main panel and back clears this up. FIXED. (Updated hourly view even when not in front.)
				41. SAXException parsing HourlyXML with Alaska locations. FIXED. (Don't try for Alaska.)
				
		Version 1.3.6
				Add call data dump for XML parse error. - IN PROGRESS
				Add space between daily forecasts to allow room for larger images from weather service. - DONE
				Add top US 25 cities - DONE

		Version 1.3.7 (Released hours after 1.3.6. No users down loaded it.)
				42. Crash when entering place names. FIXED (by removing top cities and nicknames feature.)
				
		version 1.3.8
				re-enabled top cities and nicknames feature. (FIXED Bug 42: Array out of bounds on nicknames - used array length for cities.)
				Added info about accessing temperature to about box. 
				
				Bugs
					44. Fails to update forecast following network access loss.
					45. Alaska forecasts broken due to change on weather service side.
					
		version 1.3.9 (android:versionCode 8)
				Fixed temperature and wind speed chart.
				
				Bugs
					46 Hourly data chart has ceased functioning. Error "Point is not on an NDFD grid. Point with latitude 42.5... Longitude = 0 ..."
							Why is longitude 0? I had missing "&" separating items in URL query string, invalidating my longitude. FIXED
					47.Getting null pointer exception on hazard data. FIXED
					
		version 1.3.10
				Bugs
					49. Deleting location sometimes fails. This may cause duplication of locations at the end of the list. First test whether there
						are fewer entries in the table after a deletion attempt,
						
		Version 1.4
				Licensed under GPL 2.
				Removed cases where current conditions would show "N/A".
				Moved to Android Studio development environment.
				Updated code to address most of Android Studio's compiler warnings, including:
					-- Using iterators throughout.
					-- Removing unused initializers.
				This version will also be released for free. ($0.00) 
					
				
					
		Version 2.0
						
			Features
				Add temperature and wind speed plots
				Reduce traffic by storing lat and lon in database.
				
			Deferred Bugs
				23. Refreshing forecast gives no feedback on progress
				31. Yigo, Guam forecast returns error.
					The URL seems to be for the whole island. http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?zoneid=GUZ001&FcstType=dwml and returns a HTML page.
					clicking on the map gives URL of
					http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=13.54721129739022&lon=144.8382568359375&site=gum&unit=0&lg=en
					converting this to 
					http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=13.54721129739022&lon=144.8382568359375&site=gum&unit=0&lg=en&FcstType=dwml
					http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=13.54721129739022&lon=144.8382568359375&FcstType=dwml
					both give a XML pages.
					Two thoughts
					1) I should be able to handle the error gracefully.
					2) Can defer until I have the new lookup system for locations.
				34. Multiple requests for forecast update. Occurs on app startup. May be associated with app crashing.
				35. Apply correct fix to 1) toast messages coming from background thread. 2) Database error on startup (if (locationID < -1)).
				38. Multiple copies of some locations appear. (This might be corrected by killing and restarting app - it could be an in-memory issue, not db issue.)
				43. Error when loading Somerville forecast, but not other locations. (May be related to bug 31.) Occurs Sometimes.
					Error is: expected: 'D' actual: 'd' (position:unknown @1:3 in Java.io.StringReader@446c5378)
					Cause is: null
					Stack trace [ LJavaLang.Lang.StackTraceElement;@4470d228
					03-15 18:15:39.194: I/SimplyWeather forecast(30123): URL is: http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?CityName=Somerville&state=MA&site=BOX&textField1=42.3903&textField2=-71.1018&e=0&FcstType=dwml
					URL is well-formed and returns and XML page, which appears normal.
					Error is thrown by parsePage()
				
						
						
		Bugs appearing in released version
			48. Unknown location for "Temple Texas" and "Dallas texas", but not for "Temple, texas", "Temple tx" or "Bangor Maine"
				Also error for "provincetown massachusetts", but not for "provincetown, massachusetts" or "waltham massachusetts" 
				So far the rule seems to be make sure you use a comma or abbreviation for locations in texas.  
		----
			50. Hourly forecast data sometimes not for correct location. (Solution: Pull hourly data along with regular forecast data.)
			
			51. Forecast for wrong location appears when changing location during update. 
				Steps: 1. Hit refresh button (Location 1). 2. Select location far away with clearly different weather (Location 2). 
				Result: Forecast for Location 1 appears, but dropdown indicates current location as Location 2. 
				Note: Switching to another location and then back to Location 2 causes correct forecast to appear.
				Note: Switching to temperature data and back does not clear the incorrect forecast.
				Proposed solutions: 
					When getForecast returns, it should save forecast in database, then update from database, for whatever location is currently selected.
						A simple screen refresh following database write could do this.
					refreshScreen should know what the current location is.
					Have dirty flag for location, which forces update from database when changed.
					Lock dropdown from changing locations while waiting for update (No, can cause bad user experience.)
				 			 
		
	Future Plans
		Return the location from the weather service XML file. (Maybe only if they entered "city, state", rather than ZIP). This ensures that the user knows when the weather service guessed 
			wrong on their location. 
		Severe weather alerts. - DONE
		Implement REST using info at http://www.weather.gov/forecasts/xml/rest.php. It allows the XML file to be customized to show all kinds of weather data!!

Switching build between free and paid.
	0. Check permissions. Does ad version require location?
	1. Update ./res/main.xml file. Comment or uncomment  <com.google.ads.AdView ... /> near the end of the file.
	2. Update useAds boolean.
	3. Google requires a different package
		In the first two lines of SimplyWeather.java, switch which line is commented out (package net.joncaplan.simply_weather_free; or package net.joncaplan;)
		Respond the the error generated by lint in tooltip to change package.
		Add: import net.joncaplan.ForecastManager;
			(Also had to make constructors and SetForecast, public.)
		In Forecast.java
			import net.joncaplan.simply_weather_free.SimplyWeather; (May need to switch back for regular version.)
			
				I may be able to use "rename"
